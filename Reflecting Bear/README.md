# Reflecting-Bear

This project helps us to undestand the reflection of a vector in a plane using matrices.

First we transform our vector into bear's coordinates using transfomation matrix then we apply reflection in the bear's plane using the reflection matrix and at the end we transform the vetor back into our plane using the inverse of transformation matrix.
